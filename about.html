            Seattle's seasonal variety show is back and more festive than ever! Please join us for the 4th Annual Holly Jolly Holiday Show on Saturday, December 7 at Barboza.

In typical fashion, the night begins with a showcase of holiday songs sung by a variety of singers while accompanied by pianist Holly Thornton. As the evening continues, you'll be entertained by local comedians, musicians, and drag queens!  Stay through the event and party into the night as Barboza plays holiday hits and dance remixes.

This cocktail cabaret-like affair encourages you to walk around and mingle throughout the performances. Grab photos and make new friends to the backdrop of first-time performers and seasoned professionals!

Tickets start at $20 for the first 100 tickets and move to $25 leading up to the day of the show. And, don't forget to participate in the costume contest by showing
 off your funky-fresh style for this year's theme: Holifunk. Doors open at 6:30pm, and the show starts at 7pm! 

We hope to see you there!
